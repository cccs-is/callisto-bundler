# Your upload failed.
Your notebook could not be uploaded into your *Open Humans* account. This is
most likely due to expired access credentials (this can happen if your notebooks
are running for too long at a time).

An easy way to fix this is clicking on `Control Panel` in the top right edge
of your current Notebook and pressing `Stop My Server` there. This will allow
you to stop and restart your notebook installation and afterwards the upload
should work fine.
